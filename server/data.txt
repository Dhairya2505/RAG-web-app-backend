As of June 2023, Saturn has 146 moons. 

Saturn's largest moon Titan is bigger than both Mercury and Pluto. Titan has a very thick atmosphere which is mostly nitrogen. Earth's atmosphere is also mostly nitrogen.

Saturn also has many icy moons like Mimas which has a large crater that is 1/4 the diameter of the moon, and Enceladus which has very dark material covering one side and very bright material on the other side.

Some of Saturn's smaller moons help keep Saturn's rings stable by orbiting in or near the rings. These moons are called "shepherd moons" and use their gravity to keep the small ring particles in a stable orbit. Some of the gaps in Saturn's rings are caused by these moons.
