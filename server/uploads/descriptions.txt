    I was pleasantly surprised by the Focus C65, a budget-friendly smartphone that packs a punch. As a casual photographer, I wanted a device that could handle basic photography tasks without breaking the bank. The Focus C65 delivers.
    The camera app is intuitive, and the image quality is impressive for the price range.
    The Focus C65 may not be a flagship device, but it's a great option for those on a budget. It's a solid all-rounder that covers the basics and then some.
    - Budget-friendly
    - Decent camera performance
    - Good display quality
    - Long battery
    - Not suitable for heavy gaming or professional photography
    - Limited storage (expandable via microSD),
        Quality of the phone exterior is good, it's not a great build but worth the money. Now the UI experience is again not so fast, but works well for a budget friendly phone. Colour ratio on screen is great. Camera is great. My 1st budget friendly phone which is great. Fingerprint is good and fast. Charging is slow with the given adapter. Overall for 6.8k I will not say it's bad neither mind-blowing.,
        Nice phone and budget friendly also. Screen size also good but camera is just ok. Got it at 6999 only.,
        Bought this phone for my grandfather, needed something cheap, and hence decided to go with this Poco, as I have heard that it offers good value for money.,
        And whatever I have heard, is true
        For a price of Rs. 6800, you are getting a smartphone with a big screen (90Hz), triple camera setup (50MP), dual band wifi connectivity (5GHz), fingerprint sensor, fast charging (charger in the box)
        What else do you need from this price ??
        The phone is really smooth in performance, fast in responsiveness, and ultra light weight.
        Below are the in depth details :
        Battery - 9/10
        Display - 7/10 (color quality is poor)
        Wifi - 10/10
        Performance - 10/10
        RAM Management - 10/10
        Camera - 7/10 (poor clarity in images)
        UI - 8/10 (lots of useless features and bloatware)
        So if you are looking for a good and functional smartphone, then this one is indeed a good choice for you!,
        The Poco C65 is a good option for those looking for a budget phone around 6.5k. Here are the pros and cons:
        Pros:
        - Affordable:- Great value for the price.
        - Display:- Good quality for its price segment.
        - Design:- The plastic back looks amazing, especially in black.
        - Performance:- Handles basic daily tasks well.
        - Call Recording:- Useful feature included.
        Cons:
        - Bloatware:- Comes with over 50 pre-installed, mostly useless apps.
        - Heating:- Tends to overheat, which is a big issue.
        - Ergonomics:- Not comfortable for one-handed use.
        - Sound Quality:- Poor audio performance.
        - Camera:- Below average; can take normal photos but other features are disappointing.
        -Connectivity:- Connectivity really sucks, with frequent drops and slow internet speeds.
        Verdict: In summary, after 50 days of usage, the Poco C65 is a solid choice for budget-conscious buyers around 6.5k. However, it is not worth considering if priced above 7.5k due to its limitations.,
        For the price range, this is an excellent device.
        I highly recommend this phone if you're a casual user (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), as well as a mediocre gamer. With the medium settings, Pokemon Unite hasn't slowed down or overheated for me.
        The camera is decent enough to capture good images unless you are a professional photographer.
        The only problem is charging, 10w brick takes forever to charge so I would recommend you to get a fast charger nevertheless it has an excellent battery life.,
        The Poco C65 offers impressive performance with its robust processor, vibrant display, and long-lasting battery. It's perfect for daily tasks, gaming, and multimedia, making it an excellent choice for budget-conscious consumers seeking reliable and versatile smartphones.
